Create a Minimalist Weather App using Next.js

Objective:
Develop a clean, user-friendly weather application that provides essential weather information with an elegant design. The app should demonstrate proficiency in Next.js, React hooks, API integration, and responsive design.

Key Features:

1. Location Input:
   - Implement a search bar where users can enter a city name or zip code.
   - Include autocomplete functionality for city names to improve user experience.
   - Store the last 5 searched locations in local storage for quick access.

2. Current Weather Display:
   - Show the current temperature prominently.
   - Display a brief description of the weather (e.g., "Sunny", "Partly Cloudy").
   - Include an appropriate weather icon (e.g., sun, cloud, rain).
   - Show additional details like humidity, wind speed, and feels-like temperature.

3. 3-Day Forecast:
   - Display high and low temperatures for the next 3 days.
   - Include small icons representing the weather condition for each day.
   - Show the day of the week for each forecast day.

4. Unit Toggle:
   - Create a toggle switch to change between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
   - Ensure all temperatures update immediately when the unit is changed.
   - Remember the user's preference and apply it on future visits.

5. Dynamic Theming:
   - Implement at least 4 different color schemes (e.g., Clear, Cloudy, Rainy, Night).
   - Change the app's background color, text color, and potentially icon colors based on the current weather condition and time of day.
   - Ensure smooth transitions between themes.

6. Responsive Design:
   - Create layouts optimized for mobile (320px - 480px), tablet (481px - 768px), and desktop (769px and above) screens.
   - Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layouts.
   - Ensure all features are accessible and usable across all device sizes.

7. Loading States:
   - Implement skeleton screens or loading spinners while fetching data.
   - Ensure transitions between loading and loaded states are smooth.

8. Error Handling:
   - Display user-friendly error messages for API failures, network issues, or invalid locations.
   - Provide guidance on how to resolve errors (e.g., "City not found. Please check the spelling and try again.").

9. Time Display:
   - Show the current time and date for the selected location.
   - Update the time display in real-time.
   - Format the date and time according to the locale of the selected location.

10. Search History:
    - Display the last 5 searched locations below the search bar.
    - Allow users to quickly select a previous location.
    - Provide an option to clear search history.


Deliverables:
- A fully functional Next.js application meeting all the above requirements.
- A README file with instructions on how to run the application locally.
- A brief explanation of your design decisions and any challenges faced during development.

This detailed description should provide a clear roadmap for developing the Minimalist Weather App, covering all aspects from functionality to technical implementation. It leaves room for creative design choices while ensuring a comprehensive demonstration of Next.js and React skills.
